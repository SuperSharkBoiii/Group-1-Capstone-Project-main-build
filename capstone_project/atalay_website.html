        <p>I live in Seattle, Washington with my family of four. I go to Eastside Preparatory School in Kirkland as a rising sophomore. I have taken an HTML class in 8th grade, classes on Python and Java in 9th grade, signed up for advanced programming classes for next year and am currently taking the All Star Code 3-Week Summer Intensive, on top of having an interest in programming from an early age.</p>
